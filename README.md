# Introduction to Computer Vision

*A python version*

In this project, you will find notes, screenshots and python implementations of all the concepts discussed in the lovely free Ucacity course "Introduction to Computer Vision" thankfully produced by Georgia Institute of Technology and presented by Prof. Aaron Bobick, Irfan Essa, and Arpan Chakraborty. This course provides an introduction to computer vision including fundamentals, and methods for application and machine learning classification.

## Project Instructions

1. The code in the notebooks is based on Python 3. Python 2 will fail in several cases.
2. The notebooks essentially depend on the following libraries: numpy, scipy, cv2, and PIL.
3. You will likely need to install more pip packages to run the notebooks. We assume that you have enough proficiency to install them as needed.
